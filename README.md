# Chrome-Dino-NEAT

An AI developed to play the Chrome dinosaur game by utilizing the NEAT algorithm in Python.

## How does it work

### AI Inputs

The ai gets 6 inputs from the game.

* Distance between the dino and obstacle
* Dino Y position
* Obstacle width
* Obstacle height
* Obstacle Y position
* Speed

### AI Outputs

Inputs are processed by the neural network. The network's output dictates the dino's action by identifying the highest output values.

### Fitness function

The fitness function is the score of the dino.
It's calculated using the following rules:

* +1 if the dino successfully passed the obstacle
* -1 if the dino collide with the obstacle
* +0.01 for every frame the dino is alive
* stop the game if all the dino dies

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tony-l01/Chrome-Dino-NEAT.git
   ```

2. Install the requirements
   ```
